The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon error related to specificity and inheritance:

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

p {
  color: red;
}

div p {
  color: green; /* This will override the color of both the div and the p */
}

/* This is an uncommon error: This will not override the color of both the div and the p. It will only override the color of the p */
div p {
  color: inherit;
}
```

The unusual aspect is that the `inherit` keyword does not behave as expected when dealing with multiple inherited styles with different specificity.  It only applies the immediate parent's style, ignoring previous inherited styles.
