The solution involves understanding CSS specificity and how inheritance works. Instead of relying on `inherit` in complex scenarios, explicitly declare styles to ensure predictability:

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

p {
  color: red;
}

div p {
  color: green; /* This will override the color of both the div and the p */
}

/* Solution: Explicitly set the color.  This approach avoids any ambiguity and ensures that the style is applied as intended. */
div p {
  color: purple;
}
```

By explicitly setting the color of the `div p` element, we avoid the unexpected behavior of `inherit` in situations with high specificity and multiple inherited styles.  This approach makes the styles more predictable and maintainable.
